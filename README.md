# Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with SCINet

This project aims to explore and enhance time series forecasting by employing and extending the capabilities of the SCINet architecture. We focus on evaluating the model's performance on the ETTh1 dataset and further compare it with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to assess the trade-offs between complexity and predictive performance.

## Overview

The repository contains all the necessary components used in the project, including Jupyter notebooks detailing the model training and evaluation process, the original and preprocessed datasets, and an additional contribution in the form of an MLP model for comparative analysis.

## Repository Contents

- `AIDI_1002_Final_Project_Enhancing Time Series Forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full pipeline of the project, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `AIDI_1002_Final_Project_Enhancing Time Series Forecasting.pdf`: A PDF export of the Jupyter notebook, preserving the code, outputs, and visualizations for easier viewing without running the notebook.
- `ETTh1.csv`: The dataset used in this project, which consists of time series data related to energy consumption.


## Contribution

We introduce a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model as our project contribution, implemented to compare its performance with SCINet on the same forecasting tasks. The MLP model serves as a simpler neural network benchmark, shedding light on how model complexity affects forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or directly open the `.ipynb` files in Google Colab.
2. Run the `AIDI_1002_Final_Project_Enhancing Time Series Forecasting.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the models results.
